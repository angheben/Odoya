This project it's a website for a granola company from SÃ£o Paulo

This is a project that I've made with a frontend developer, she made the templates and ask me to make de backend

In the backend I've create a database for the products of the company where the admin of the page are able to make a CRUD with the products and the user are able
to see the products of the company and select wich one he wants to buy

Also, I connect all the URLs

The website looks like that:

Unfortunately, the site was not live because the developer preferred to use another backend technology, but it was a great learning experience for me and 
the first project together with someone else.
